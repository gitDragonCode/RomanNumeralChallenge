# RomanNumeralChallenge
4-hour coding challenge to convert roman numerals to modern numbers and vice versa.
I began this project by creating a flowchart, included as 'RomanNumeralsChallenge.png' and then moving on to the code itself.
I did not get far into creating the code before running out of time.
As requested, I am not panicking and submitting what I have, noting that I would continue to follow the flowchart if more time were available.
